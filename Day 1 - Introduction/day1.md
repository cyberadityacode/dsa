**Day 1** of DSA Bootcamp.

Todayâ€™s focus is **understanding algorithms & problem-solving basics** (no code yet, just thinking).

---

## Concept of the Day: What is an Algorithm?

- An **algorithm** is just a **step-by-step procedure** to solve a problem.
- Itâ€™s not language-dependent. You can write it in English, pseudocode, or any programming language.
- Example: Algorithm to brush your teeth ðŸ˜„

  1. Pick up toothbrush
  2. Apply toothpaste
  3. Brush for 2 mins
  4. Rinse with water

See? Thatâ€™s an algorithm

## Your Tasks (Day 1)

### **Task 1: Algorithm for Making a Cup of Tea**

Write the step-by-step algorithm (in plain English) for making tea.

- Think about inputs (water, tea leaves, milk, sugar).
- Think about sequence (boil water â†’ add tea leaves â†’ add sugar â†’ add milk â†’ serve).

---

### **Task 2: Algorithm for Finding Largest of 3 Numbers**

Suppose you are given three numbers: A, B, C.
Write an algorithm in **plain steps** (not code yet) to find which is the largest.

- Hint: Youâ€™ll use comparisons (`>`).
- Example steps:

  1. Compare A and B â†’ store bigger in `max`.
  2. Compare `max` with C â†’ update if C is bigger.
  3. Final `max` is the answer.

ðŸ’¡ Remember: Donâ€™t worry about syntax yet. Just **logical steps** are enough today.

## Format for Writing an Algorithm

When you write an algorithm, try to keep it structured:

Step 1 â†’ Start

Step 2 â†’ Input (whatâ€™s required?)

Step 3 â†’ Process (step-by-step logic)

Step 4 â†’ Output (final result)

Step 5 â†’ End

## Example 1: Algorithm to Make Tea
1 . Start

2. Take a pan and add water.

3. Boil the water.

4. Add tea leaves.

5. Add sugar.

6. Add milk and boil for 2 minutes.

7. Filter the tea into a cup.

8. Output: A cup of tea is ready.

9. End

## Example 2: Algorithm to Find the Largest of 3 Numbers (A, B, C)

1. Start

2. Input three numbers: A, B, C.

3. Compare A and B.

4. If A > B â†’ set max = A.

5. Else â†’ set max = B.

6. Compare max with C.

7. If C > max â†’ set max = C.

8. Output the value of max (largest number).

End

Would you like me to also show you an **example format for writing algorithms** before you attempt?
