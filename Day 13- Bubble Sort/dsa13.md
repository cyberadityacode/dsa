The Performance Leap: Sorting Algorithms 📊Now that you have Big O, Multiple Pointers, and Recursion in your toolkit, we are ready to tackle one of the most important topics in computer science: Sorting.Why is sorting a "big deal"? Because, as we saw with Binary Search, many of the fastest algorithms in the world only work if the data is sorted first.1. The "Novice" Sorts ($O(n^2)$)These are easy to understand but slow for large datasets. They include:Bubble Sort: Swapping adjacent elements until the largest "bubbles" to the top.Selection Sort: Finding the minimum and moving it to the front.Insertion Sort: Building a sorted section one item at a time (like sorting a hand of cards).2. The "Expert" Sorts ($O(n \log n)$)These use Recursion and "Divide and Conquer" to be incredibly fast.Merge SortQuick Sort

Let's start with the classic: Bubble Sort 🫧In Bubble Sort, we compare two items at a time. If the one on the left is larger than the one on the right, we swap them. We repeat this until the entire array is sorted.Why it's $O(n^2)$To sort the array, you have to loop through it $n$ times, and for each of those times, you perform another loop to compare the items.Outer Loop: $n$Inner Loop: $n$Total: $n \times n = O(n^2)$
